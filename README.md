# FieaGameEngine
 
This is an in-progress basis for a data driven game engine that I am currently working on as part of my graduate studies.

Included are some built-from-scratch containers that can generically handle data that form a foundation for the game engine to come.

My unit tests, using the Microsoft CppUnitTestFramework are also included.
